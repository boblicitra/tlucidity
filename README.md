# Time Lucidity

Simple time tracking application designed for anyone to use to enter their own time or have an administrative assistant to do it for them.  Roles can be assigned so a user can enter time for multiple timekeepers.  THe default is for entry for only one timekeeper.
System was designed to import pre-defined client and case data from external systems but the Django admin panel could be used to maintain these tables.
